The basic feature of an image organizer is to edit tags of the photo. It is a good medium to upload files to hosting pages. <br>Some typical features of an image organizer app include the ability to view thumbnail previews. Albums can be created for images and then be organized into collections. You can add tags like keywords, labels, categories, or flags. These images can also be exported, resized, mailed, or printed. </p><p>Photo editors have become increasingly common, especially on mobile devices for the basic editing of photos. However, if you're a design professional you'll need the best photo editor software.</p><h3>Here are a few reasons why you should organize your photos:</h3><p><strong>Easy to find photos</strong> - If a client wants to purchase a particular image a year after you did the shoot, how will you find the images? Or, if you need to submit a few nature photos for a competition, you should have a proper system to locate them. Whether you are just organizing your photos by adding keywords, tags, stars, or color codes; you need to know what works best for you. And you should be familiar with the system to use it efficiently when a good opportunity knocks on your door. </p><p><strong>Check your progress</strong> - When you spend some time organizing your photos, you get a good idea on how you have progressed this far. You will notice how good or bad the photo was earlier and how your interest has shifted over the years. You can divide your work based on the subject, project, or theme. This process will give a direction to your vision as a photographer and will make you understand what kind of subjects you love shooting. After years of working, a photographer starts to develop an ingenious style. An amateur photographer will also notice early patterns in the photography style by following the process of organizing. </p><p><strong>Deep analysis </strong>- The process of selecting your best work, allows you to analyze your photos. Try to figure out the reason why you like certain images and dislike others. Think about what made you capture those good images and what happened in the bad ones. Doing this will improve your way of looking and help in creating better images. </p><p><strong>Revisit ideas</strong> - When you revisit your old photos, you can revisit old concepts and ideas. You will realize what mistakes you made or things that you may have missed. You can now take a new approach to the same ideas and improvise them. </p><h2>Best Ways to Organize Photos</h2><h2>Printed Photos</h2><p>To organize printed photos follow these steps: </p><ol><li>Buy a large set of similar-looking photo albums and photo boxes. Doing this will maintain consistency for an extended period of time. </li><li>Write the date or the name of the person in the photo, or some identifying feature about the photo. </li><li>Make sure you use an acid-free pen or pencil, which is safe for photos. You can get it from an art store near you.</li><li>Discard all the bad photos, which are badly exposed, blurred, or which you wouldn't want to keep. </li><li>Select the ones you like the most and put them in frames or albums.
